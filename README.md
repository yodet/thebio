Hi, my name is Yodet! Located in the Greater Seattle area, I am an educator with 4 years of experience in an array of youth enrichment programs from beginner-level coding to music. I was the youngest employee to be promoted from assistant to lead teacher. I taught elementary students how to code using kid-friendly software, while also getting advanced students acclimated with video game design.

I am a great communicator, I can adapt to any environment, and am always willing to mirror my clients to provide the best possible experience-- my skills reach double the people! It is my passion to make people feel heard and understood. I mirror my colleagues or business partners by being a team player and always ready to collaborate with others.

I consider myself a creative mediator and have worked in various projects to bring people to channel their creative side in order to create solutions for team productivity and conflict resolution. I appreciate the little things, so I'm always up for a day in nature or passing some time with farm animals in my free time. If youâ€™d like to set a meeting time for conflict resolution and tech talk, feel free to shoot me an email!
