Hi my name is Yodet, Im an educator with 4 years experience in an array of youth enrichment programs from beginner level coding to music. 

I am a great communicator so i know my skills reach double the people which is the most fulfilling thing to me honestly 

I love making people feel heard and understood, so I mirror my collegues or business partners by adapting and blending to different environments. 

Also, I consider myself a creative, and have worked in various projects to bringing people to channel their creative side, Iâ€™d love to set a meeting time with you to show you my templates!
